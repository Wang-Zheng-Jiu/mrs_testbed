This testbed includes:
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) packages for multi-robot exploration
- [MORSE](https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse) simulation scenarios
- Scripts for autonomous deployment of the infrastructure and experiments (computer cluster required)

To have a general idea, please refer to the videos below, respectively showing simulated and real robot exploration:

## Overview ##

![alt tag](https://github.com/yzrobot/mrs_testbed/blob/master/architecture.png)

The testbed is composed of four parts: a simulator, a monitor, a set of robot controllers, and the ROS middleware used to connect all of them. In particular, we use the MORSE 3D realistic simulator and wrap it up into a ROS node. The monitor is also performed as a ROS node, which allows us to supervise the experimental processes. Specifically, it can stop the experiment when the stop condition is triggered, collect measurement data and compute the metrics afterwards.

## Prerequisites ##

* ROS Groovy or +
* MORSE 1.2 or +
